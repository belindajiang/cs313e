 1. What is the output of the following?

For odd n it's computing (3n + 1) / 2.
(3n + 1) / 2
3n/2 + 1/2
n + n/2 + 1/2
n + n/2 + 1, because n is odd

 2. Given positive integers, b and e, let m = (e / 2) + 1.
    If b < m, then max_cycle_length(b, e) = max_cycle_length(m, e).
    True or False?
    [Collatz]
    (2 pts)

True

Consider b = 10, e = 100.
Then m = (100 / 2) + 1 = 51.
max_cycle_length(10, 100) = max_cycle_length(51, 100)
All the numbers in the range [10, 50] can be mapped to numbers in the
range [51, 100] by one or more doublings, so none of the numbers in the
range [10, 50] could have a larger cycle length than the numbers in the
range [51, 100].
